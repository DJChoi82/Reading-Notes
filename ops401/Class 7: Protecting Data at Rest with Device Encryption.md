Data in transit is data that is moving from on e location to another. Data at rest is data that is not moving and stored on a drive or another way. Data is at risk at both in transit and at rest. There are multiple ways to protect data in transit and at rest. The most effective data protection is encryption. In addition to encrytion other controls can be implemented for best practices. Other security soloutions like firewalls and network access controls can be used to secure the network used to transmit data.
